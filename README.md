## oazssh - Open an ssh connection

Open an ssh connection to an azure linux VM.

Usage: `oazssh [-e <env>] [-k keyfile] [-s srv || -S servername]`

You can supply a short name, like ap0 or db1 with `-s` or a full name with `-S`.  Short name implies a linux server.  A full means you supply the complete VM name and it has to match the environment (default: dev).

You can also provide the filename of a different ssh key (assumed to be located in `~/.ssh`) using `-k keyfile`.

```
oazssh -e dev -s ap0
```

Connects to the app-0 host in the dev environment.

## oazssht - ssh tunnel

Start an ssh (or other) tunnel via the bastion.

Usage: `oazssht [-e <env>] [-k keyfile] [-s srv || -S servername][ -w | -l] [-l local_port] [-r remote_port]`

```
# in one shell:
oazssht -e dev -s ap0 

# in another:
ssh -p 5555 adminuser@localhost
# or
scp -P 5555 adminuser@127.0.0.1:file file
```

Or for an RDP connection to a windows box:

```
oazssht -e d -S az1dwepcmepcad1 -r 3389 -l 3389
```

Then use your RDP client to connect to localhost.


## Retrieve a password from keyvault

This command shows how to copy a value from the key vault to use (for RDP connections).  This retrieves the password for dev:

```
az keyvault secret show \
    --name "passwd-cus-dev-epc-mepc-adobe-server" \
    --vault-name "kv-cus-dev-epc-mepc" \
    --query "value" --output tsv \
    | pbcopy
```
